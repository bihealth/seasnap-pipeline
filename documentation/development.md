SeA-SnaP development
--------------------

---

There are three SeA-SnaP branches in the development cycle:

 * master
 * master_rc
 * development

Feel free to add your new features and merge requests to development (but
make sure you test them!).

Feel free to add documentation and bug fixes **in your code** to the
`master_rc` branch.

However, **do not** add new features to `master_rc` and do not fix code of
others in that branch without discussing it with others. 

Feel free to add documentation to the `master` branch. Do not add new
features to that branch (obviously), and for bug fixes submit merge
requests rather than fix the bugs yourself. Make sure that your bug fixes
have been thoroughly tested.
